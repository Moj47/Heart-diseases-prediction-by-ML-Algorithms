# ❤️ Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting heart disease using multiple machine learning algorithms.
The main goal is not only achieving high accuracy, but also making **medically meaningful predictions** 🩺.

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
Each model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score  

⚠️ In medical problems, **Recall and F1-score are critical**, since missing a patient with heart disease can have serious consequences.

---

## 🏆 Results Summary

Among all tested models, **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** showed the best overall performance:

- 🧠 ANN achieved the **highest Recall and F1-score** on the test set.
- 📉 Most traditional ML models reached decent accuracy but failed to detect positive cases.
- ❌ KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest had extremely low Recall values.
- ⚖️ Logistic Regression showed good Precision but poor Recall, making it too conservative.

📌 **Final Conclusion:**  
Despite some overfitting, **ANN is currently the most reliable model** for heart disease detection in this project.

---

## 🔍 Why ANN Performed Better
- Captures **non-linear relationships** more effectively
- More flexible decision boundaries
- Better balance between Precision and Recall compared to classical models

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Yes… I know 😅 This project is still rough around the edges(It has awful result for now).

Planned updates include:
- 🛠 Better feature engineering
- ⚖️ Handling class imbalance properly
- 🎯 Hyperparameter tuning
- 🔁 Cross-validation
- 🧪 Model optimization and regularization

This repository will be updated as the project evolves.
